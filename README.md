# ML Touch Panel
Created for [Deep Learning Superhero Challenge with Intel](https://www.hackster.io/contests/DLSuperheroes). <br/>

Project contains two neural networks:
* CNN for sound event detection
* [Fully-Convolutional Siamese Networks for Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09549)

Two C++ applications:
* Configurator to configure camera's frame warping to match screen's surface
* Runtime that connects all of the parts of the project and emulates mouse using both neural networks and Intel's OpenVINO with Neural Compute Stick 2.
